Easy add customizable moving or static ticker tapes with stock information for custom stock symbols.

== Description ==

A simple and easy configurable plugin for WordPress that allows you to insert stock ticker with stock price information to posts, pages, widgets or even to template files. Insertion is enabled by shortcode or multi instance widget.

Please note, stock data has been provided by [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/) which does not support indexes since mid-2020!

Stock Ticker is advanced variation of [Stock Quote](https://wordpress.org/plugins/stock-quote/) plugin.

**Multisite WordPress is not supported yet**

**IMPORTANT** Stock Ticker does not have own Gutenberg Block, so you can use Shortcode Block or Common Block to insert Stock Ticker within the post/page content.

== Disclaimer ==

All stock data used in **Stock Ticker** is provided by **Alpha Vantage**, displayed for informational and educational purposes only and should not be considered as investment advise.

Author of the **Stock Ticker** plugin does not accept liability or responsibility for your use of plugin, including but not limited to trading and investment results. Along to that, author of **Stock Ticker** plugin can not guarantee that stock prices are always accurate as they are provided by 3rd party service for free.

== Features ==

* Set global set of symbols you'll use site-wide
* Configure default set of stock symbols that will be displayed in ticker inserted by empty shortcode
* Configure default presence of company as Company Name or as Stock Symbol
* Configure colours for unchanged quote, negative and positive changes with colour picker
* Disable scrolling ticker and make it static
* Define custom names for companies to be used instead of the symbols
* Define custom elements as a part of visible value
* Optional (BETA) Intraday time series for equity. Known issues because of 15min timeframe: RANGE and VOLUME are wrong. Because indexes does not have VOLUME, so for indexes and currencies TIME_SERIES_DAILY will be used

You can set custom template for visible change value. Default format is `%company% %price% %change% %changep%`. As a macro keywords you can use:

* `%exch_symbol%` - Symbol with exchange, like *NASDAQ:AAPL*
* `%symbol%` - Company symbol, like *AAPL*
* `%company%` - Company name after filtered by custom names, like *Apple Inc.*
* `%price%` - Price value, like *125.22*
* `%change%` - Change value, like *-5.53*
* `%changep%` - Change percentage, like *-4.23%*
* `%ltrade%` - Last trade day (like *2020-09-25*), which can be followed by [the PHP date format](https://www.php.net/manual/en/datetime.format.php) to customize date output, separate by pipe character, eg. *|l, jS \of F Y*

== Hall of Fame ==

Kudos to [patchstack researchers](https://patchstack.com/database/vulnerability/stock-ticker) for early reporting vulnerabilities!

A big **thank you** goes to [@flexer](https://wordpress.org/support/users/flexer/), [@khunmax](https://wordpress.org/support/users/khunmax/), [@k2_1971](https://wordpress.org/support/users/k2_1971/) and [@vijaleshk](https://wordpress.org/support/users/vijaleshk/) who do tests with alpha versions of plugin until we finally released v3.0.0. And also important to mention [@eigood](https://wordpress.org/support/users/eigood/) who pointed me to AlphaVantage.co as a replacement for Google Finance.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to know which stock symbols to use? =

You can use standard symbols from stock exchanges supported by AlphaVantage.co.
For example, you can try with AAPL, MSFT, IBM, CSCO, GOOG, YHOO, AMZN (Apple Inc; Microsoft Corporation; International Business Machines Corporation; Cisco Systems, Inc.; Google Inc; Yahoo! Inc; Amazon.com, Inc.)
To check if AlphaVantage.co support your preferred symbol(s), you can use *Symbol Search & Test* tool on plugin settings page to search for keysords and symbols on AlphaVantage.co directly from your WordPress dashboard.

= Stock Exchange or Symbol I need does not work! =

Try to find correct symbol on AlphaVantage.co by looing for it in *Symbol Search & Test* tool. Even try alternatives or company name. If that does not help, search Alpha Vantage community forum [www.alpha-vantage.community](https://www.alpha-vantage.community/)

= How to get Dow Jones Industrial Average or other Indexes? =

Unfortunately, AlphaVantage.co no longer supports indexes (mid-2020). That is why Stock Ticker no longer provide quotes for them.

= How to get Crude Oil, Gold and other commodities? =

Unfortunately, AlphaVantage.co does not support commodities (metals, energies, grains, meats, softs). That is why Stock Ticker can't provide quotes for them.

= How to get currency exchange rate? =

Use Currency exchange symbols like `EURGBP` to get rate of `1 Euro` = `? British Pounds`
Please note, since mid-2020 AlphaVantage.co does not support anymore format `EURGBP=X` so use syntax without `=X`.

= How to get proper stock price from proper stock exchange? =

Enter symbol in format `EXCHANGE:SYMBOL` like `LON:LLOY` or `SYMBOL.EXCHANGE` like `LLOY.LON` for Lloyds Banking Group Plc from London Stock Exchange market.
Please note that AlphaVantage.co does not provide stock data always for all existing stocks.

= How to get descriptive title for currency exchange rates? =

Add to `Custom Names` legend currency exchange symbol w/o `=X` part, like:

`EURGBP;Euro (â‚¬) â‡¨ British Pound Sterling (Â£)`

= How to add Stock Ticker to header theme file? =

Add this to your template file (you also can add custom parameters for shortcode):

`<?php echo do_shortcode('[stock_ticker]'); ?>`

= How to customize quote output? =

On Settings page for plugin you can set custom Value template. You can use macro keywords `%exch_symbol%`, `%symbol%`, `%company%`, `%price%`, `%volume%`, `%change%`, `%changep%` and `%ltrade%` mixed with HTML tags `<span>`, `<em>` and/or `<strong>`.

Default template is `%company% %price% %change% %changep%` but you can format it like:

`<span style="color:#333">%company%</span> <em>%price%</em> <strong>%change%</strong> %changep%`

= I set to show `%company%` but symbol is displayed instead =

Please note that Alpha Vantage does not provide company name in retrieved feeds. You'll need to set company name in *Custom Names* field on plugin settings page.

= How to resolve error `Unfortunately, we could not get stock quotes this time`? =

This can be temporary issue. First try to run `Fetch Stock Data Now!` on plugin settings page.

If that does not help, next try to increase *Fetch Timeout* option on general plugin settings and then run `Fetch Stock Data Now!`.

If you still experiencing issue, please contact us through [support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/stock-ticker).

= Can I get stock data for my custom code? =

Since version 3.1 of Stock Ticker you can get stock data in custom functions. Fore example:

`
<?php
if ( class_exists( 'Wpau_Stock_Ticker' ) ) {
	$stock_data = Wpau_Stock_Ticker::get_stock_from_db( 'AAPL,MSFT' );
	var_dump( $stock_data );
}
?>
`

That will return associated array for requested symbols:
`
array(2) {
  ["AAPL"]=>
  array(11) {
    ["symbol"]=>
    string(4) "AAPL"
    ["tz"]=>
    string(10) "US/Eastern"
    ["last_refreshed"]=>
    string(19) "2018-09-14 00:00:00"
    ["last_open"]=>
    string(8) "225.7500"
    ["last_high"]=>
    string(8) "226.8400"
    ["last_low"]=>
    string(8) "222.5220"
    ["last_close"]=>
    string(8) "223.8400"
    ["last_volume"]=>
    string(8) "31999289"
    ["change"]=>
    string(7) "-2.5700"
    ["changep"]=>
    string(7) "-1.1351"
    ["range"]=>
    string(19) "222.5220 - 226.8400"
  }
  ["MSFT"]=>
  array(11) {
    ["symbol"]=>
    string(4) "MSFT"
    ["tz"]=>
    string(10) "US/Eastern"
    ["last_refreshed"]=>
    string(19) "2018-09-14 00:00:00"
    ["last_open"]=>
    string(8) "113.3600"
    ["last_high"]=>
    string(8) "113.7300"
    ["last_low"]=>
    string(8) "112.4400"
    ["last_close"]=>
    string(8) "113.3700"
    ["last_volume"]=>
    string(8) "19122349"
    ["change"]=>
    string(6) "0.4600"
    ["changep"]=>
    string(6) "0.4074"
    ["range"]=>
    string(19) "112.4400 - 113.7300"
  }
