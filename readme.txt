Easy add customizable moving or static ticker tapes with stock information for custom stock symbols.

== Description ==

A simple and easy configurable plugin for WordPress that allows you to insert stock ticker with stock price information to posts, pages, widgets or even to template files. Insertion is enabled by shortcode or multi instance widget.

Please note, stock data has been provided by [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/)

Stock Ticker is advanced variation of [Stock Quote](https://wordpress.org/plugins/stock-quote/) plugin.

**Multisite WordPress is not supported yet**

**IMPORTANT** Stock Ticker does not have own Gutenberg Block, so you can use Shortcode Block or Common Block to insert Stock Ticker within the post/page content.

== Disclaimer ==

All stock data used in **Stock Ticker** is provided by **Alpha Vantage**, displayed for informational and educational purposes only and should not be considered as investment advise.

Author of the **Stock Ticker** plugin does not accept liability or responsibility for your use of plugin, including but not limited to trading and investment results. Along to that, author of **Stock Ticker** plugin can not guarantee that stock prices are always accurate as they are provided by 3rd party service for free.

== Features ==

* Set global set of symbols you'll use site-wide
* Configure default set of stock symbols that will be displayed in ticker inserted by empty shortcode
* Configure default presence of company as Company Name or as Stock Symbol
* Configure colours for unchanged quote, negative and positive changes with colour picker
* Disable scrolling ticker and make it static
* Define custom names for companies to be used instead of the symbols
* Define custom elements as a part of visible value
* Optional (BETA) Intraday time series for equity. Known issues because of 15min timeframe: RANGE and VOLUME are wrong. Because indexes does not have VOLUME, so for indexes and currencies TIME_SERIES_DAILY will be used

You can set custom template for visible change value. Default format is `%company% %price% %change% %changep%`. As a macro keywords you can use:

* `%exch_symbol%` - Symbol with exchange, like *NASDAQ:AAPL*
* `%symbol%` - Company symbol, like *AAPL*
* `%company%` - Company name after filtered by custom names, like *Apple Inc.*
* `%price%` - Price value, like *125.22*
* `%change%` - Change value, like *-5.53*
* `%changep%` - Change percentage, like *-4.23%*

== Installation ==

To install Stock Ticker and make initial setting to work, please follow instructions below

https://youtu.be/_tSQ5-ODVfs

1. Go to `Plugins` -> `Add New`
1. Search for `Stock Ticker` plugin
1. Install and activate `Stock Ticker`
1. Get a free API Key from [AlphaVantage.co](https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key)
1. In WordPress Dashboard go to `Settings` -> `Stock Ticker`
1. Enter to field `AlphaVantage.co API Key` Alpha Vantage API Key you received in previous step (check [this screenshot](https://goo.gl/3PKxLM))
1. Enter to field `All Stock Symbols` all stock symbols you’ll use on whole website in various widgets and shortcodes, separated by comma. This field is used to fetch stock data from AlphaVantage.co API by AJAX in background. Because AV have only API to get data for single symbol, that can take a while to get. Please note, for default shortcode symbols there is still have field in Default Settings section of plugin.
1. Save settings and click button `Fetch Stock Data Now!` to initially fetch stock data to database and wait for a while until we get all symbols from AlphaVantage.co for the very first time.
1. Insert shortcode `[stock_ticker]` to page or post, or `Stock Ticker` Widget to preferred Widget Area.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to know which stock symbols to use? =

You can use standard symbols from supported stock exchanges.
To start with you can try with AAPL,MSFT,IBM,CSCO,GOOG,YHOO,AMZN (Apple Inc; Microsoft Corporation; International Business Machines Corporation; Cisco Systems, Inc.; Google Inc; Yahoo! Inc; Amazon.com, Inc.)

= How to get Dow Jones Industrial Average or other Indexes? =

Since version 3.0.0 we use Alpha Vantage, which support Indexes. To get quote for index, simply add symbol as `.DJI` (or `^DJI` if you prefer).

= How to get currency exchange rate? =

Use Currency symbols like `EURGBP=X` to get rate of `1 Euro` = `? British Pounds`

= How to get Crude Oil, Gold and other commodities? =

Unfortunately, Alpha Vantage does not provide data for commodities (metals, energies, grains, meats, softs). That is why Stock Ticker can't provide quotes for them.

= How to get proper stock price from proper stock exchange? =

Enter symbol in format `EXCHANGE:SYMBOL` like `LON:FFX` for FairFX Group PLC from London Stock Exchange market.

= Stock Exchange or Symbol I need does not work! =

If Stock Exchange or symbol you need does not work (like `BVMF:BVMF3`), first look for your symbol on [Yahoo! Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com) and try to use symbol Yahoo put in parenthesys (like `BVMF3.SA` for our example, or `^BSESN` for index of Bombay Stock Exchange of India).

If you already set proper symbol but no data got fetched from AlphaVantage, please verify that Alpha Vantage have data for your symbol. If they don't support symbol you need, feel free to ask AlphaVantage support to include it to their data set by community forum [www.alpha-vantage.community](https://www.alpha-vantage.community/)

= How to get descriptive title for currency exchange rates? =

Add to `Custom Names` legend currency exchange symbol w/o `=X` part, like:

`EURGBP;Euro (€) ⇨ British Pound Sterling (£)`

= How to add Stock Ticker to header theme file? =

Add this to your template file (you also can add custom parameters for shortcode):

`<?php echo do_shortcode('[stock_ticker]'); ?>`

= How to customize quote output? =

On Settings page for plugin you can set custom Value template. You can use macro keywords `%exch_symbol%`, `%symbol%`, `%company%`, `%price%`, `%volume%`, `%change%` and `%changep%` mixed with HTML tags `<span>`, `<em>` and/or `<strong>`.

Default template is `%company% %price% %change% %changep%` but you can format it like:

`<span style="color:#333">%company%</span> <em>%price%</em> <strong>%change%</strong> %changep%`

= I set to show `%company%` but symbol is displayed instead =

Please note that Alpha Vantage does not provide company name in retrieved feeds. You'll need to set company name in *Custom Names* field on plugin settings page.

= How to resolve error `Unfortunately, we could not get stock quotes this time`? =

This can be temporary problem. First try to access front-end page with appended parameter `?stockticker_purge_cache=1`.

If that does not help, next try to increase *Fetch Timeout* option on general plugin settings and then visit frontend page with appended address parameter `?stockticker_purge_cache=1`.

If you still experiencing issue, please contact us through [support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/stock-ticker) and don't forget to provide URL to your website where you have inserted Stock Ticker.

= Can I get stock data for my custom code? =

Since version 3.1 of Stock Ticker you can get stock data in custom functions. Fore example:

`
<?php
if ( class_exists( 'Wpau_Stock_Ticker' ) ) {
	$stock_data = Wpau_Stock_Ticker::get_stock_from_db( 'AAPL,MSFT' );
	var_dump( $stock_data );
}
?>
`

That will return associated array for requested symbols:
`
array(2) {
  ["AAPL"]=>
  array(11) {
    ["symbol"]=>
    string(4) "AAPL"
    ["tz"]=>
    string(10) "US/Eastern"
    ["last_refreshed"]=>
    string(19) "2018-09-14 00:00:00"
    ["last_open"]=>
    string(8) "225.7500"
    ["last_high"]=>
    string(8) "226.8400"
    ["last_low"]=>
    string(8) "222.5220"
    ["last_close"]=>
    string(8) "223.8400"
    ["last_volume"]=>
    string(8) "31999289"
    ["change"]=>
    string(7) "-2.5700"
    ["changep"]=>
    string(7) "-1.1351"
    ["range"]=>
    string(19) "222.5220 - 226.8400"
  }
  ["MSFT"]=>
  array(11) {
    ["symbol"]=>
    string(4) "MSFT"
    ["tz"]=>
    string(10) "US/Eastern"
    ["last_refreshed"]=>
    string(19) "2018-09-14 00:00:00"
    ["last_open"]=>
    string(8) "113.3600"
    ["last_high"]=>
    string(8) "113.7300"
    ["last_low"]=>
    string(8) "112.4400"
    ["last_close"]=>
    string(8) "113.3700"
    ["last_volume"]=>
    string(8) "19122349"
    ["change"]=>
    string(6) "0.4600"
    ["changep"]=>
    string(6) "0.4074"
    ["range"]=>
    string(19) "112.4400 - 113.7300"
  }
